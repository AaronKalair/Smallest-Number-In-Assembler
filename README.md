This is a simple program, written in assembler which finds the smallest of five numbers hardcoded at the start of the program.

It was written for an assignment at the University of Warwick and runs on a program called MicSim which simulates a microprocessor, similar to the 68000. Unfortunatly I do not believe it is available outside the university.
